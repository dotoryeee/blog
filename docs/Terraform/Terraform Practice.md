- EC2에 SSH 접속을 위한 키페어 생성
    1. 비밀키를 생성합니다

    ```s
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -f ~/dotoryeee.pem -q -P 
    ```
        
    2. pem을 사용하려면 권한을 수정해야 합니다

    ```s
    chmod 400 ~/dotoryeee.pem
    ```
        
    3. AWS에 넘겨줄 공개키를 생성합니다

    ```s
    ssh-keygen -y -f ~/dotoryeee.pem > ~/dotoryeee.pub
    ```

    [](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs)
    
- 에러가 자주 났던 부분
    1. EC2 t2.micro는 서울기준 2a, 2c에서만 지원됩니다
    2. VPC 사이더 범위가 서브넷보다 넓은지 확인
    3. MySQL RDS생성시 allocated_storage값에 0은 불가능
    4. DB인스턴스는 별도로 서브넷 그룹을 생성해야 함

    ```s
    Error: Error creating DB Instance: InvalidParameterCombination: The DB instance and EC2 security group are in different VPCs. The DB instance is in vpc-7ae25b11 and the EC2 security group is in vpc-07d48e73dba07404a
    status code: 400, request id: 25f97e75-89d9-4323-9cd3-b09e83675d4e on [rds.tf](http://rds.tf/) line 16, in resource "aws_db_instance" "rds":
    16: resource "aws_db_instance" "rds" {
    ```
        
    5. RDS는 반드시 서브넷 2개 이상을 묶어서 구성
    6. 베스천 호스트 사용하는 RDS는 당연시 퍼블릭 엑세스 제한
        
    ```s
    Error: Error creating DB Instance: InvalidVPCNetworkStateFault: Cannot create a publicly accessible DBInstance.  The specified VPC does not support DNS resolution, DNS hostnames, or both. Update the VPC and then try again
    status code: 400, request id: d26672f9-7f0a-40ac-9e17-6fd0b9fa2558
    ```
        
    7. ssh 접속을 위한 map_public_ip_on_launch (서브넷) 당연히 true
    8. RDS는 생성에 오랜 시간이 걸리는 점 유의
        
        ![Terraform Practice/Untitled.png](Terraform Practice/Untitled.png)
        
    9. 보안그룸 이름은 소문자 sg로 시작할 수 없음
    10. RDS 보안그룹은 security_group_names 대신 vpc_security_group_ids 사용

    ```
    Error: Error creating DB Instance: InvalidParameterCombination: DB Security Groups can only be associated with VPC DB Instances using API versions 2012-01-15 through 2012-09-17.
    ```
